## General

All Manchu phrases are head-final; the head-word of a phrase (e.g. the noun of a noun phrase, or the verb of a verb phrase) always falls at the end of the phrase. Thus, adjectives and adjectival phrases always precede the noun they modify, and the arguments to the verb always precede the verb. As a result, Manchu sentence structure is subject–object–verb (SOV).

Manchu uses a small number of case-marking particles that are similar to those found in Korean, but there is also a separate class of true postpositions. Case markers and postpositions can be used together, as in the following sentence:

> bi tere niyalma-i emgi gene-he
> 
> 
> I that person-GEN with go-PST
> 
> I went with that person
> 

In this example, the postposition **emgi**, "with", requires its nominal argument to have the genitive case, which causes the genitive case marker **i** between the noun **niyalma** and the postposition.

Manchu also makes extensive use of converb structures and has an inventory of converbial suffixes to indicate the relationship between the subordinate verb and the finite verb that follows it. An example is these two sentences, which have finite verbs:

> tere sargan boo qi tuqi-ke
> 
> 
> that woman house ABL go out-PST.FIN
> 
> That woman came out of the house
> 

> tere sargan hoton de gene-he
> 
> 
> that woman town DAT go-PST.FIN
> 

Both sentences can be combined into a single sentence by using converbs, which relate the first action to the second:

> tere sargan boo qi tuqi-fi, hoton de gene-he
> 
> 
> that woman house ABL go out-PST.CVB, town DAT go-PST.FIN
> 
> That woman, having come out of the house, went to town.
> 

> tere sargan boo qi tuqi-me, hoton de gene-he
> 
> 
> that woman house ABL go outp-IMPERF.CVB, town DAT go-PST.FIN
> 
> That woman, coming out of the house, went to town.
> 

> tere sargan boo qi tuqi-qibe, hoton de gene-he
> 
> 
> that woman house ABL go out-CONC.CVB, town DAT go-PSF.FIN
> 
> That woman, though she came out of the house, went to town

## Nouns

Manchu nouns have number and case but do not really have gender. Nouns can consist solely of a stem such as 'bithe' (book), be formed by adding suffixes to other words, or be formed by adding two nouns together such as 'ahvn deo' (brothers).

### Number

There are several ways to express the plural in Manchu:

1. Through the use of the suffix -sa (-se, -so, -si):
   E.g. manju**sa** - Manchu**s**

2. Through use of one of the suffixes -ta, -te, -ri:

   E.g. ama**ta** - father**s**

3. Through the use of adjectives:
   like geren (many/all), eiten (all), tumen (a myriad) or verbally with gemu (all)

### Case

Manchu has five cases. Cases can be attached to the proceeding noun or written separately:

1. Nominative (no suffix)
   This is the natural case and has no suffix.
   E.g. bithe - book
2. Genitive (-i, -ni after -ng)
   This case is used to show the possessive. The suffix -i (-ni) can also be used for instrumental case which shows the means or cause of which something happens.
   E.g. ere oci mini eme **i** bithe - This is my mother'**s** book (*Possessive*)
   E.g. mafa gurun **i** ilha - The fatherland'**s** flowers (*Possessive*)
   E.g. manju gisun **i** arambi - To write **by means of** Manchu (*Instrumental*)
3. Dative/Locative (-de)
   This case is used to show location or direction (at/to).
   E.g. Direction: Harbin **de** genehe - He went **to** Harbin (*Dative*)
   E.g. Location: Harbin **de** manjusa labdu - There are many Manchus **in** Harbin (*Locative*)
   E.g. Beijing **de** niyengniyeri isinaha - **In** Beijing spring has arrived
4. Accusative (-be)
   This case is used to make a noun the direct object of an action.
   E.g. i ere bithe **be** mini eme de buha - He gave **this** book to my mother
   E.g. te mini eme inenggidari manju gisun **be** tacimbi - Now my mother studies **Manchu** everyday.
   E.g. be mafa gurun **be** hairambi - We love the **fatherland**
5. Ablative (-ci)
   This case is used to show point of departure or for comparison.
   E.g. monggo gurun **ci** jihe niyalma - The people who came **from** Mongolia (*Point of departure*)
   E.g. nikan gisun **ci** manju gisun ja - Manchu is easier **than** Chinese (*Comparison*)
   E.g. emu inenggi **ci** emu inenggi halukan oho - Each day is hotter **than** the one before (*Comparison*)

## Verbs

### Introduction

Manchu verbs (except for three non-changing verbs) all consist of a stem and a final. The dictionary form of a Manchu verb is the present tense form, which includes the verb stem and the suffix ‘-mbi’. E.g.: Arambi (to write) consists of ara + -mbi. All changes for mood or tense in Manchu verbs are done by removing the suffix ‘-mbi’ and by adding another suffix to indicate the tense or mood of the verb (more on this later).

Manchu verbs can be divided into:

- Original verbs (固有动词) – These are verbs that are not derived from nouns, adjectives or other verbs and include verbs such as ‘arambi’ (to write) etc.
- Verbs derived from other words (派生动词) – These are verbs that are derived from either nouns, adjectives or other verbs (see voice of Manchu verbs).

Verbs derived from nouns and adjectives are usually formed by adding one of the following suffixes (see table for list of common suffixes) to the end of a noun or an adjective (note the final ‘n’ of the noun or adjective being turned into a verb is usually dropped):

| **Suffix**     | **Noun or adjective**        | **Verb formed by adding suffix** |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ‘-ta’ (te, to) | dasan (politics, management) | dasatambi (to put in order)      |
| ‘-da’ (de, do) | jali (crafy)                 | jalidambi (to cheat)             |
| ‘-na’ (ne, no) | acan (a union)               | acanambi (to meet)               |
| ‘-la’ (le)     | aba (a hunt)                 | abalambi (to hunt)               |
| ‘-ra’ (re, ro) | gisun (language)             | gisurembi (to speak)             |
| ‘-xa’ (xe, xo) | adali (similar)              | adalixambi (to be similar)       |

### Regular, irregular and non-changing verbs

Verbs can also be divided into three categories depending on the change in the verb suffix:

Regular verbs – These are verbs that follow regular suffix change patterns.

Irregular verbs – These are verbs that don’t follow regular suffix change patterns (see irregular verb table 8.3 for full list).

Non-changing verbs – These are three verbs that only have one fixed form. These verbs consist of only a verb stem, although grammatically, they feature all the same properties as regular and irregular verbs. The three non-changing verbs are:

- ‘bi’ – To have (有).
- ‘akv’ – To not have (没有).
- ‘joo’ – To forget about it, not worry about it (算了)

### Tense in Manchu verbs

The conjugation of Manchu verbs is constant regardless of the person doing the action. I.e. the conjugation for you went and I went would both be 'gene**he'**. This means only one suffix has to be learnt for each of the tenses. It is convenient to split Manchu tenses into simple tenses (of which there are three) and complex tenses all of which are formed from the simple tenses with the addition of either converbs (such as -me or -fi) or auxiliary verbs (such as bi). See table:

| **Tense (时)**       | **Suffix**                    | **Example**          | **Translation**                       |

### Voice in Manchu verbs

The first voice is the subjective voice, which is the normal verb form. All other voices are formed by adding a suffix between the stem of the verb and the final ‘-mbi’. This forms a new verb. For example: taci-mbi (to study), taci-bu-mbi (to teach). Tacibumbi is the active form of the verb tacimbi and therefore has a completely different meaning. Note: suffixes for tense and mood can be added to the end of the new form of the verb as the suffixes for voice are part of the verb stem. E.g. tacibuha (I taught), tacibura (I will teach), etc.

The seven voices (note the two directional voices count as one voice) are:

1) 主动 Subjective

This is the normal voice of the verb and does not take any suffix. E.g.

- tacimbi - To study

2) 使动 Active (-bu-, -(m)bu-)

This voice shows that you are doing the action to something or someone. You would usually use the case marker ‘be’ to show what you are doing the action to. E.g.

- bi simbe manju gisun taci**bu**ha - I taught you Manchu
- bi imbe gene**bu**he - I let him go

3) 被动 Passive (-bu-, -(m)bu-)

This voice shows that the action is being done to you. You would usually use the case marker ‘de’ to indicate the direction of the action. E.g.

- bi tere de tanta**bu**ha - I was bashed up by him

4) 方向去 Dir (to) (-na-, -ne-, -no-)

This voice shows the direction of an action and is similar to English ‘to go’. E.g.

- bithe hvla**na**mbi - To go and read
- si bithe uda**na**ci - If you go and buy books

5) 方向来 Dir (fr) (-ji-, -(n)ji-)

This voice shows the direction of an action and is similar to English ‘to come’.E.g.

- bithe hvla**ji**mbi - To come and read
- Xiao Wang ya erinde isin**ji**mbi? - When does xiao Wang arrive?

6) 齐动 Cooperative (-ca-, -ce-, -co-)

This voice indicates that an action is being done by a group. It is similar to the English word ‘together’. E.g.

- tese tacikv de efi**ce**mbi - They are playing together at school
- eten i forgon de urgule**ce**he - Together we celebrate in victory

7) 互动 Reciprocal (-nu-, -ndu-)

This voice is used to indicate reciprocal action. It is similar to the English word ‘each other’. E.g.

- nadan gurun ada**ndu**me nakarakv - The seven kingdoms fought each other without end
- niyalmasa ishunde aisila**ndu**mbi - The people help each other out

8) 连续 Continuous (-da-,-de-;-ta-,-te-;-xa-,-xe-,-xo-; -ca-,-ce-,-co-; -ja-,-je-, -jo-)

This voice is used to indicate the continuous nature of an action and is like English ‘always’, or ‘often’

- bi simbe aisila**ta**mbi - I often/always help you

### Forms of the Manchu verb

The Manchu verb has 6 basic forms:

1) Affirmative

This is the normal form of the verb. E.g.

- bi te manju gisun be tacime ilihabi - I am currently studying Manchu
- boode mini ama bi - My father is at home
- bi abalara de indahvn gamambi - I take dogs when I go hunting

2) Negative

This form is the negative form of the verb. Manchu unlike English forms the negative form of a verb by adding suffixes to the verb stem. The two negative forms of Manchu verbs are:

| Present negative | -rakv                | ara**rakv** | Don’t write  |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Past negative    | -hakv (-hekv, -hokv) | ara**hakv** | Didn’t write |

Some further examples of the negative form are:

- bi harbin de gene**hekv** - I did not go to Harbin
- bi manju gisun be gisure**rakv** - I don't speak Manchu

3) Interrogative

This is the question form of the verb. The interrogative form has both a positive and a negative form. The negative form is then further divided into a present and past negative interrogative form. The negative interrogative from is basically formed by adding -n to the end of the negative form of the verb (see table):

| Interrogative                    | -o                     | arara**o**?   | Are you writing?     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Negative Interrogative (present) | -rakvn                 | ara**rakvn**? | Are you not writing? |
| Negative Interrogative (past)    | -hakvn(-hekvn, -hokvn) | ara**hakvn**? | Did you not write?   |

Some further examples of the interrogative form are:

- si abalara de indahvn gamambi**o**? - Do you take dogs when you go hunting?
- si xiao wang be tuwa**rakvn**? - Do you not see Xiao Wang?
- si harbin de gene**hekvn**? - Haven't you been to Harbin?

4) Imperative

The imperative form is the form of the verb that is used when you want to tell somebody to do (or not do) something. In Manchu there is a polite imperative form, a negative imperative form and a normal imperative form (see table):

| Imperative            |                        | ara           | Write!       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Imperative (negative) | ume ……. -ra (-re, -ro) | ume ara**ra** | Don’t write  |
| Imperative (pol 1)    | -rao (-reo, -roo)      | ara**rao**    | Write please |
| Imperative (pol 1)    | -ki                    | bu**ki**      | Please give  |

Some further examples of the imperative form are:

- tuwa (look!)
- inde **ume** tuwa**ra** - Don't look at him
- si gala be obu**roo** - Wash your hands please
- minde tere bithe be bu**ki** - Can you please give me that book

5) Optative

The optative form is where you want another person to do something. There are three different optative forms in Manchu (see table):

| Optative 1 | -kini       | ara**kini**        | May he write          |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Optative 2 | -cina       | ara**cina**        | I hope you will write |
| Optative 3 | -kini sembi | mara**kini sembi** | I want you to return  |

Some further examples of the optative form are:

- si ere buda be jacina - I hope you will eat this food
- bi simbe harbin hoton de genekini sembi - I want you to go to Harbin

6) Desiderative

The desiderative form is where you want to do something. It corresponds to English I want to, or I will. Note the -ki form of the desiderative can also be used as a polite imperative. There are two different desiderative forms in Manchu (see table):

| Desiderative 1 | -ki       | ara**ki**        | I will write    |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Desiderative 2 | -ki sembi | taci**ki sembi** | I want to study |

Some further examples of the desiderative form are:

- bi sinde majige okto bu**ki** - I will give you some medicine
- bi amga**ki sembi** - I want to sleep

#### Converbs (副动词)

The main converbs in Manchu are:

1) Coordinative -me

This converb modifies the following verb and can be used to link several verbs. It also expresses simultaneous action, or can be used to start a quote. E.g.

- ai baita be ara**me** genembi? (what are you going to do)
- yacin gvlmahvn sakda niman i boode efi**me** genehe (the black rabbit went to the old mountain goat's house to play.)
- suwe ai erinde guri**me** jihengge? (when did you move here?)
- ajige xanyan gvlmahvn jabu**me**:... (the small white rabbit said:....)

2) Subordinative -fi

Refers to a sequence of actions where one action is completed before another one begins. It is like English 'then', and also a bit like 'because' E.g.

- bi gene**fi** tuwaki (I will go and (then) have a look)
- ajige yacin gvlmahvn lafu sogi be gai**fi**, hendume:"yeyede baniha!" (the small black rabbit took the bok choi and then said: thank you grandfather)
- yacin gvlmahvn ningge jetere jaka akv o**fi**, geli sakda niman i boode sogi baime genehe (As the small black rabit had nothing to eat, he then went to the old mountain goat's house to ask for more vegetables)

3) Conditional -ci

This is the conditional converb and is similar to English 'if'. E.g.

- bi tuwa**ci** (if I look)
- jalan de suwe akv**ci** ergen de jurgan akv ni (If this world did not have you all, then life would have no meaning)
- si Harbin de gene**ci** (if you go to Harbin)

4) Durative -hai (-hei, -hoi)

This converb is used to express that an action occurs or continues at the same time as another action is performed. E.g.

- necimbi**hei** yabumbi (to continuously invade)

5) Terminative -tala (-tele, -tolo)

This converb is used to show that an action occurs up to a certain time.

- ara**tala** (until he writes)
- te**tele** (till now)

6) Instrumental -tai (-tei, -toi)

This converb is used to show that an action is being forced

- buce**tei** daharakv (I will not submit even if I die)

7) Preparative -nggala (-nggele, -nggolo)

This converb is like English ‘before’

- utala inenggi o**nggolo** (several days ago)

8) Concessive -cibe

This converb is like Enlgish ‘although’

- tuttu bi**cibe** (although it is like that)

9) Alternative -ralame (-relame, -rolame)

This converb is used to show that two actions are being performed at the same time

- bi yabu**ralame** tuwambi (looking as I’m going along)

10) Simultaneous -mbime

This converb is used to show that one action is occurring (or not) while another action takes place

- si baita be sambi se**mbime**, ainu takarakv (while you say you know about the matter, how come you don’t?)

#### auxiliary verbs

Three important auxiliary verbs in Manchu are:

- sembi – sembi means ‘to say’
- ombi – ‘ombi’ can be translated as ‘to become’, ‘to be’, ‘to act as’,
- bimbi – ‘bimbi’ can be translated as ‘to be or ‘is’.

## Adverbs

Adverbs are words that modify other words except for nouns. Adverbs usually express the time, place or degree of an action and typically answer questions such as how?, when? why? or where? Manchu adverbs can be primitive adverbs which are indeclinable words such as ‘inu’ (yes) or they can be formed by adding suffixes (usually case markers) to the end of nouns, or pronouns. Most numerals can also be used as adverbs.

Some common Manchu adverbs include:

| **Manchu** | **English**        | **Manchu** | **English**            |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |
