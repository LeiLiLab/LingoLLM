However, I'll do my best with the phrase you've provided.\n\nThe phrase \"andase sain dedu\" can be broken down as follows:\n- \"andase\" might be related to \"anda,\" which can mean \"friend\" or \"companion.\"\n- \"sain\" is often translated as \"good\" or \"well.\"\n- \"dedu\" could be a form of \"de,\" which can be a postposition meaning \"in\" or \"at,\" but without more context, it might be challenging to determine its exact role.\n\nA rough translation could be:\n### Good friend ###\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic translation and might not capture the full nuance of the original Manchu phrase."
