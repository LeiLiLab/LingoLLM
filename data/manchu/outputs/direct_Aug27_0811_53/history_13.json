    "content": "Translating from Manchu can be challenging due to the limited resources and context available. However, I'll do my best to provide a translation based on the elements of the sentence:\n\n- \"abka\" generally means \"heaven\" or \"sky.\"\n- \"gosifi\" could be related to \"descending\" or \"coming down.\"\n- \"beye\" means \"body\" or \"self.\"\n- \"elhe\" can mean \"to lose\" or \"to be lost.\"\n- \"oqi\" is often used as a conjunction, similar to \"and\" or \"then.\"\n- \"isinambi\" could be related to \"to live\" or \"to exist.\"\n- \"dere\" typically means \"earth\" or \"land.\"\n\nGiven these components, a rough translation might be:\n\n### \"When heaven descends, the body is lost, and then exists on earth.\" ###\n\nPlease note that this translation may not fully capture the nuances of the original Manchu sentence, but it is an attempt to convey the general meaning."
