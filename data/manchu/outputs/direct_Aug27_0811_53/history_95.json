However, I will do my best to provide a translation based on the available knowledge.\n\nThe phrase \"andase sain dedu\" can be broken down as follows:\n- \"andase\" could be related to \"anda,\" which means \"friend\" or \"comrade.\"\n- \"sain\" generally means \"good\" or \"well.\"\n- \"dedu\" might be a form of the verb \"to say\" or \"to speak.\"\n\nGiven these interpretations, a possible translation of \"andase sain dedu\" could be:\n\n### Speak well, friend ###\n\nPlease note that this is a rough translation and might not capture the full nuance of the original Manchu text."
