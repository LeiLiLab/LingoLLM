    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"sikse teni jihe\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **sikse**: This word translates to \"yesterday\" in English.\n\n2. **teni**: This word has several possible translations: \"just,\" \"then and only then,\" \"not until,\" and \"for the first time.\" In the context of the sentence, \"just\" or \"then and only then\" seem to be the most appropriate, as they can imply a specific time reference related to \"yesterday.\"\n\n3. **jihe**: This is the perfect participle form of the verb \"jimbito,\" which means \"to come.\" Therefore, \"jihe\" translates to \"came\" in English.\n\nNow, let's construct the translation of the sentence:\n\n- \"sikse\" (yesterday)\n- \"teni\" (just/then and only then)\n- \"jihe\" (came)\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence \"sikse teni jihe\" can be translated to English as:\n\n###Yesterday, he/she/they just came###"
