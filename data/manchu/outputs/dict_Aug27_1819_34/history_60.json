    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **uttu oqi**: This phrase translates to \"if it is like this\" or \"if so.\" It suggests a conditional or hypothetical situation.\n\n2. **bi**: Given the context, the most appropriate translation for \"bi\" would be \"circumstances\" or \"occasion,\" as it fits the narrative structure better than the other options like \"place\" or \"land.\"\n\n3. **duleke**: This is the perfect participle form of \"dulembi,\" which means \"to pass\" or \"to go by.\" In this context, \"passed\" or \"gone by\" would be suitable.\n\n4. **aniya**: This translates to \"year.\"\n\n5. **gemun**: This word means \"the Imperial capital\" or \"the capital.\"\n\n6. **heqen**: This translates to \"city\" or \"city wall.\" In this context, \"city\" is more appropriate.\n\n7. **de**: This is a dative/locative particle, translating to \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" \"on,\" or \"by.\" Here, \"in\" or \"at\" would fit the context.\n\n8. **bihe**: This is the perfect converb form of \"bimbi,\" which means \"to exist,\" \"to be,\" or \"to have.\" In this context, \"was\" or \"existed\" is appropriate.\n\n9. **hvda**: This translates to \"business,\" \"price,\" \"value,\" or \"goods.\" In this context, \"business\" seems most fitting.\n\n10. **emu**: This means \"one\" or \"1.\"\n\n11. **adali**: This translates to \"like\" or \"same.\"\n\nNow, putting it all together, the sentence \"uttu oqi bi duleke aniya gemun heqen de bihe hvda emu adali\" can be translated to English as:\n\n###If so, in the circumstances of the past year, there was a business in the capital city like one.###"
