    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"si unenggi tubade genefi hvdaxaqi majige aisi bio\" word by word:\n\n1. **si**: This word can mean \"you\" (singular), but given the context of the sentence, it is more likely to mean \"space, gap, interval.\" However, without more context, \"you\" seems the most straightforward translation.\n\n2. **unenggi**: This word means \"truly,\" \"really,\" or \"honestly.\" It indicates sincerity or truthfulness.\n\n3. **tubade**: This word means \"there\" or \"at that place.\" It refers to a specific location.\n\n4. **genefi**: This is a perfect converb form of \"gene,\" which means \"to go\" or \"to leave.\" It suggests a completed action of going or leaving.\n\n5. **hvdaxaqi**: This is derived from \"hvdaxambi,\" which means \"to engage in business\" or \"to trade.\" The imperfect converb form \"hvdaxame\" suggests an ongoing or habitual action. Here, \"hvdaxaqi\" seems to indicate the act of engaging in business or trading.\n\n6. **majige**: This word means \"a little,\" \"a little bit,\" or \"somewhat.\" It suggests a small amount or degree.\n\n7. **aisi**: This word means \"interest,\" \"benefit,\" or \"profit.\" It refers to something advantageous or beneficial.\n\n8. **bio**: This is an interrogative particle combined with \"bi,\" which means \"to exist,\" \"to be,\" or \"to have.\" It turns the sentence into a question.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the sentence can be translated as:\n\n###\"Did you really go there to engage in a little business for profit?\"###"
