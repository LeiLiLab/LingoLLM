    "content": "Let's break down the sentence word by word using the given dictionary entries:\n\n1. **jodon**: The word \"jodon\" can mean \"grass linen,\" \"grass cloth,\" or \"kudzu-hemp cloth.\" However, it is derived from the parent word \"jodombi,\" which means \"to weave\" or \"to come and go unexpectedly.\" In this context, \"jodon\" likely refers to a type of cloth or fabric, as it fits better with the context of \"hvda\" (goods).\n\n2. **hvda**: This word can mean \"business,\" \"price, value,\" or \"goods.\" Given the context of \"jodon\" (a type of cloth), \"hvda\" is best translated as \"goods.\"\n\n3. **duleke**: This is the perfect participle form of \"dulembi,\" which means \"to pass\" or \"to go by.\" In this context, \"duleke\" likely means \"passed\" or \"gone by.\"\n\n4. **aniya**: This word means \"year.\"\n\n5. **i**: This is a genitive particle, which can be translated as \"of\" or \"belonging to.\"\n\n6. **hvda**: As before, this word can mean \"business,\" \"price, value,\" or \"goods.\" In this context, it again refers to \"goods.\"\n\n7. **emu**: This word means \"one\" or \"1.\"\n\n8. **adali**: This word means \"like\" or \"same.\"\n\n9. **sere**: This is the imperfect participle form of \"sembi,\" which means \"to say,\" \"to call,\" or \"to mean.\" It is often used to conclude a quotation or indicate hearsay. In this context, it suggests that the information is reported or quoted.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n- \"jodon hvda\" translates to \"cloth goods.\"\n- \"duleke aniya\" translates to \"the past year.\"\n- \"i hvda\" translates to \"of goods.\"\n- \"emu adali\" translates to \"the same as one.\"\n- \"sere\" indicates hearsay or reported speech, so it suggests that the information is being reported.\n\nCombining these translations, the sentence can be interpreted as: \"The cloth goods of the past year are said to be the same as one.\"\n\nTherefore, the translation of the sentence is:\n\n###The cloth goods of the past year are said to be the same as one.###"
