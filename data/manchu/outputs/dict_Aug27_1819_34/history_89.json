In this case, please choose the most appropriate one.\nNote that for some words, they might be derived from a more basic form, we call this the parent word. The parents are also given in the word by word translation.\nHere is the dictionary entry for each individual word in the source sentence:\n\n### emu\none, 1\n### anda\n1. usual, ordinary, common 2. order, discipline\n### jumanggi\na small bag\n### de\n(dative/locative particle) to, in, at, on, by\n### emu\none, 1\n### kiyan\n1. a paper measure equaling twenty-five sheets, a quire 2. anything folded or bound together\n### hooxan\n1. paper 2. hvwaxan 'a Buddhist monk'\n### be\n1. we (exclusive) 2.

    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"emu anda jumanggi de emu kiyan hooxan be tebufi\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **emu**: This word translates to \"one\" or \"1\" in English.\n\n2. **anda**: The possible translations are \"usual,\" \"ordinary,\" \"common,\" \"order,\" or \"discipline.\" In this context, \"ordinary\" seems the most appropriate, as it likely describes the type of bag.\n\n3. **jumanggi**: This translates to \"a small bag.\"\n\n4. **de**: This is a dative/locative particle, translating to \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" \"on,\" or \"by.\" In this context, it indicates the location or destination, so \"in\" or \"into\" would be appropriate.\n\n5. **emu**: Again, this translates to \"one\" or \"1.\"\n\n6. **kiyan**: The translations are \"a paper measure equaling twenty-five sheets, a quire\" or \"anything folded or bound together.\" Given the context of \"hooxan\" (paper), \"a quire\" is the most fitting translation.\n\n7. **hooxan**: This word translates to \"paper.\" The alternative translation \"a Buddhist monk\" does not fit the context here.\n\n8. **be**: This functions as an accusative particle in this context, marking the direct object of the verb.\n\n9. **tebufi**: This is the perfect converb form of \"tebumbi,\" which can mean \"to pour,\" \"to set out,\" \"to plant,\" \"to fill a vessel,\" \"to fill a pipe,\" \"to pack,\" \"to put in,\" \"to install (an official),\" \"to make (liquor),\" \"to distill,\" or \"to place a corpse in a coffin.\" The parent word \"tembi\" means \"to sit,\" \"to reside,\" \"to live,\" or \"to occupy (a post).\" In this context, \"to pack\" or \"to put in\" seems most appropriate, as it likely describes the action of placing the paper into the bag.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n- \"One ordinary small bag in\" suggests the action of placing something into the bag.\n- \"One quire paper\" is the object being placed into the bag.\n- \"Pack\" or \"put in\" is the action being performed.\n\nTherefore, the sentence translates to:\n\n###One ordinary small bag was packed with one quire of paper.###"
