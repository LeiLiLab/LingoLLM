    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"gemun heqen i jetere jaka hajio elgiyen\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **gemun**: This word translates to \"the Imperial capital\" or \"the capital.\"\n\n2. **heqen**: This word translates to \"city\" or \"city wall.\" In this context, it likely refers to \"city.\"\n\n3. **i**: This is a genitive particle meaning \"of\" or \"belonging to.\" It indicates possession or association.\n\n4. **jetere jaka**: This phrase translates to \"foodstuffs,\" \"victuals,\" or \"food.\" It is derived from the imperfect participle of \"jembi,\" which means \"to eat.\"\n\n5. **hajio**: This word has several meanings, including \"dear,\" \"beloved,\" \"affection,\" \"fond of,\" \"addicted to,\" \"scarce,\" \"lean (year),\" and \"famine.\" In this context, \"scarce\" or \"famine\" seems appropriate given the topic of food.\n\n6. **elgiyen**: This word translates to \"prosperous,\" \"rich,\" \"plentiful,\" or \"abundant.\"\n\nNow, let's put these meanings together to translate the sentence:\n\n- \"gemun heqen i\" translates to \"of the capital city.\"\n- \"jetere jaka\" translates to \"foodstuffs\" or \"food.\"\n- \"hajio elgiyen\" can be interpreted as \"scarce\" and \"abundant,\" which might seem contradictory. However, in this context, it could mean \"scarce in abundance,\" suggesting a situation where food is generally abundant but currently scarce.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence \"gemun heqen i jetere jaka hajio elgiyen\" can be translated as:\n\n###The foodstuffs of the capital city are scarce in abundance.###"
