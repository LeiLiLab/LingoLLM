    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"gemu bahanambio bahanarakvn\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **gemu**: This word can mean \"all,\" \"in every case,\" or \"even\" as an adverb. In the context of this sentence, \"all\" or \"in every case\" seems appropriate, as it sets a comprehensive or inclusive tone.\n\n2. **bahanambio**: This word is derived from \"bahanambi,\" which can mean \"to go to get,\" \"to be able,\" \"to know how to do something,\" \"to experience,\" or \"to understand.\" Given the context and the structure of the sentence, \"to be able\" or \"to know how to do something\" seems most fitting, as it implies capability or understanding.\n\n3. **bahanarakvn**: This is a negative imperfect participle form of \"bahanambi.\" The root \"bahanambi\" has meanings such as \"to go to get,\" \"to be able,\" \"to know how to do something,\" \"to experience,\" or \"to understand.\" The negative participle \"bahanarakvn\" suggests \"not being able\" or \"not knowing how to do something.\"\n\nNow, let's translate the sentence considering the meanings of each word:\n\n- \"gemu\" suggests a sense of totality or universality, so \"all\" or \"in every case.\"\n- \"bahanambio\" suggests the ability or capability to do something.\n- \"bahanarakvn\" indicates the lack of ability or understanding.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence \"gemu bahanambio bahanarakvn\" can be translated to:\n\n###All are unable###"
