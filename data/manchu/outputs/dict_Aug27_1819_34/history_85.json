    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence word by word using the provided dictionary entries and context:\n\n1. **duleke**: This is the perfect participle form of \"dulembi,\" which means \"to pass\" or \"to go by.\" In this context, it is likely referring to time that has passed, so \"passed\" or \"gone by\" is appropriate.\n\n2. **aniya**: This translates to \"year.\"\n\n3. **qi**: This can be a comparative or ablative participle, meaning \"than\" or \"from, by way of.\" In this context, it likely means \"since\" or \"from.\"\n\n4. **ebsi**: This means \"hither, up until now, since.\" It indicates a time reference, similar to \"since.\"\n\n5. **abka**: This has multiple meanings, but given the context, \"sky\" or \"heaven\" is most likely appropriate.\n\n6. **hiya**: This word has several meanings, but \"dry\" seems to fit best in this context, especially if referring to weather conditions.\n\n7. **ofi**: This is the perfect converb form of \"ombi,\" meaning \"to become\" or \"to be.\" In this context, it likely means \"became\" or \"was.\"\n\n8. **usin**: This translates to \"field\" (for cultivation).\n\n9. **jeku**: This means \"grain, provisions, food.\"\n\n10. **bargiyahakv**: This is the perfect participle form of \"bargiyambi,\" meaning \"to store, to preserve, to protect.\" In this context, \"not stored\" or \"not preserved\" is appropriate.\n\n11. **aniya**: Again, this translates to \"year.\"\n\n12. **haji**: This word can mean \"scarce, lean (year), famine.\" Given the context of a dry year and lack of stored provisions, \"famine\" or \"scarce\" is appropriate.\n\nNow, let's translate the sentence:\n\nThe sentence describes a situation where a year has passed since the sky became dry, and fields did not store grain, leading to a scarce or famine year.\n\n###Since the year passed when the sky became dry, it was a year of famine with fields not storing grain.###"
