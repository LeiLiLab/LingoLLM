    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **inenggidari**: This means \"every day.\" It is derived from the parent word \"inenggi,\" which means \"day\" or \"daytime.\"\n\n2. **gersi**: This refers to \"the break of day\" or \"dawn.\" It indicates the early morning time.\n\n3. **fersi**: This seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete entry, as the dictionary entry is not clear. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine its exact meaning, but it could be related to the morning or dawn, given its position after \"gersi.\"\n\n4. **de**: This is a dative/locative particle, meaning \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" \"on,\" or \"by.\" It indicates direction or location.\n\n5. **ilifi**: This is the perfect converb form of \"ilimbi,\" which means \"to stand,\" \"to get up,\" \"to stop,\" or \"to raise.\" In this context, \"ilifi\" could mean \"having stood\" or \"having gotten up.\"\n\n6. **taqikv**: This means \"school\" or \"learning.\" It is derived from the parent word \"taqimbi,\" which means \"to learn\" or \"to study.\"\n\n7. **de**: Again, this is the dative/locative particle, meaning \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" \"on,\" or \"by.\"\n\n8. **genefi**: This is the perfect converb form of \"genembi,\" which means \"to go\" or \"to leave.\" Here, \"genefi\" could mean \"having gone\" or \"having left.\"\n\n9. **sefu**: This means \"teacher\" or \"master.\"\n\n10. **de**: Once more, this is the dative/locative particle, meaning \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" \"on,\" or \"by.\"\n\n11. **bithe**: This means \"book,\" \"letter,\" or \"written symbol.\"\n\n12. **taqimbi**: This means \"to learn\" or \"to study.\"\n\nNow, let's construct the translation of the sentence:\n\n- \"Every day at dawn, having gotten up, having gone to school, to the teacher, study the book.\"\n\nPutting it all together in a more natural English sentence:\n\n###Every day at dawn, having gotten up, go to school to the teacher to study the book.###"
