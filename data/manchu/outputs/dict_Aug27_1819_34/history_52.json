    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"age si daqi yabuha niyalma\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **age**: This word can mean \"prince, son of an Emperor,\" or it can be a polite term of address such as \"master, sir, lord.\" Given the context of the sentence, which appears to be a narrative or descriptive sentence, \"sir\" or \"lord\" might be more appropriate.\n\n2. **si**: This word primarily means \"you\" (singular). It is a pronoun used to address someone directly.\n\n3. **daqi**: This word can mean \"from the beginning, once upon a time, formerly, hitherto.\" In this context, it seems to indicate a past action or state, so \"formerly\" or \"once upon a time\" could be appropriate.\n\n4. **yabuha**: This is the perfect participle form of \"yabumbi,\" which means \"to go, to walk, to leave.\" The perfect participle form \"yabuha\" would translate to \"gone\" or \"left.\"\n\n5. **niyalma**: This word means \"man, person,\" or \"another person, someone else, others.\" In this context, \"person\" or \"someone\" would be appropriate.\n\nNow, let's put these meanings together to form a coherent English sentence:\n\n- \"age\" as \"sir\" or \"lord\"\n- \"si\" as \"you\"\n- \"daqi\" as \"formerly\" or \"once upon a time\"\n- \"yabuha\" as \"gone\" or \"left\"\n- \"niyalma\" as \"person\" or \"someone\"\n\nCombining these, the sentence \"age si daqi yabuha niyalma\" can be translated to:\n\n###Sir, you are the person who has gone (or left) formerly.###"
