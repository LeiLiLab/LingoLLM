    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"bithe giyangname wajifi jai aibe kiqembi\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **bithe**: This word can mean \"book,\" \"letter,\" \"written symbol,\" or \"civil.\" In the context of the sentence, \"book\" or \"letter\" seems most appropriate, but without more context, \"book\" is a common choice.\n\n2. **giyangname**: This means \"to explain\" or \"to comment on.\"\n\n3. **wajifi**: This is derived from \"wajin,\" meaning \"the finish\" or \"the end,\" with the parent verb \"wajimbi,\" which means \"to finish,\" \"to end,\" \"to be done completely,\" or \"to die.\" In this context, \"having finished\" or \"after finishing\" seems appropriate.\n\n4. **jai**: This word can mean \"next,\" \"following,\" \"second,\" \"still,\" \"again,\" \"more,\" \"later,\" or \"and.\" In this context, \"and\" seems to fit well as a conjunction.\n\n5. **aibe**: This is the accusative form of \"ai,\" which means \"what?\" or \"which?\" It can also be an exclamation of regret or admiration. Here, it likely functions as \"what\" in the accusative case, meaning \"what\" as the object of the verb.\n\n6. **kiqembi**: This word can mean \"to strive,\" \"to exert oneself,\" \"to be diligent,\" \"to apply oneself,\" \"to concentrate on,\" \"to be intent on,\" \"to study,\" \"to make plans,\" \"to strive to obtain,\" \"to seek,\" or \"to pursue (a goal).\" In this context, \"to strive\" or \"to study\" seems appropriate.\n\nNow, let's translate the sentence considering the context:\n\n\"bithe giyangname wajifi jai aibe kiqembi\" could be translated as:\n\n###Having finished explaining the book, and striving for what?###"
