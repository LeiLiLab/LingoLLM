    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"morin dobori orho be jeterakv oqi tarhvrakv\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **morin**: This word can mean \"horse\" or refer to \"the seventh of the earth's branches (\u5348).\" In the context of this sentence, \"horse\" seems more appropriate as the sentence structure suggests a more concrete subject.\n\n2. **dobori**: This word means \"night.\"\n\n3. **orho**: This word can mean \"grass,\" \"hay,\" or \"plant.\" Given the context, \"grass\" or \"hay\" is likely the intended meaning, especially if related to feeding or grazing.\n\n4. **be**: This is an accusative particle in this context, marking the direct object of the sentence.\n\n5. **jeterakv**: This is the negative imperfect participle of \"jembi,\" which means \"to eat.\" Thus, \"jeterakv\" translates to \"not eaten\" or \"uneaten.\"\n\n6. **oqi**: This particle is used to set off the topic, translating to \"as for.\"\n\n7. **tarhvrakv**: This word can mean \"fat\" or \"a mussel.\" In this context, \"fat\" is more likely the intended meaning, possibly describing the condition of the horse or the grass.\n\nNow, let's put these meanings together to form a coherent English translation:\n\n- \"As for the horse, the grass at night is uneaten and fat.\"\n\nThis suggests that the horse has not eaten the grass at night, and the grass is described as \"fat,\" possibly indicating it is lush or abundant.\n\n###As for the horse, the grass at night is uneaten and fat.###"
