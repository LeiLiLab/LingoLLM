    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"se udu oho\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **se**: This word has multiple meanings, but in the context of this sentence, it is likely used as a plural suffix. The other meanings such as \"year,\" \"raw silk,\" or \"the juncture of the stem and root on the ginseng plant\" do not seem to fit well with the other words in the sentence.\n\n2. **udu**: This word can mean \"How many?\", \"How much?\", \"several,\" or \"although.\" Given the context of the sentence, \"several\" seems to be the most appropriate translation. The other meanings imply a question or a concessive clause, which doesn't fit well with the structure of the sentence.\n\n3. **oho**: This is the perfect participle of \"ombi,\" which means \"to become,\" \"to change into,\" \"to be,\" \"to exist,\" \"to be proper,\" or \"to be permissible.\" In this context, \"oho\" likely means \"became\" or \"were,\" indicating a state of being or existence.\n\nPutting these meanings together, the sentence \"se udu oho\" can be translated to convey the idea of \"several\" things or people existing or becoming. The most coherent translation would be:\n\n###Several were###"
