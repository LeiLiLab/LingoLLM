    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence word by word using the provided dictionary entries and then translate it into English.\n\n1. **ubaqi**: This is the ablative form of \"uba,\" which means \"hence\" or \"from here.\" It indicates a starting point or origin.\n\n2. **gemun**: This means \"the Imperial capital\" or simply \"the capital.\"\n\n3. **heqen**: This translates to \"city\" or \"city wall.\"\n\n4. **de**: This is a dative/locative particle that means \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" \"on,\" or \"by.\" It indicates the location or direction.\n\n5. **isinarangge**: This is the imperfect participle form of \"isinara,\" which comes from \"isinambi,\" meaning \"to reach\" or \"to arrive (at that place).\"\n\n6. **amba**: This means \"big,\" \"great,\" \"vast,\" or \"important.\"\n\n7. **muru**: This can mean \"form,\" \"shape,\" \"appearance,\" \"lay (of the land),\" \"style,\" \"manner,\" or \"nearly,\" \"almost.\" In this context, it likely refers to \"form\" or \"appearance.\"\n\n8. **sunja**: This means \"five.\"\n\n9. **tanggv**: This means \"one hundred.\"\n\n10. **ba**: This can mean \"place,\" \"location,\" \"land,\" or \"\u91cc\" (l\u01d0), which is a Chinese mile equivalent to 0.5 kilometers. In this context, it likely refers to \"l\u01d0\" as a measure of distance.\n\n11. **funqembi**: This means \"to be left over\" or \"to be in excess.\"\n\nNow, let's construct the translation by combining these meanings:\n\n- \"ubaqi\" indicates the starting point, so \"from here.\"\n- \"gemun heqen de\" means \"to the capital city.\"\n- \"isinarangge\" indicates the action of \"arriving.\"\n- \"amba muru\" describes the size or form, so \"a great form.\"\n- \"sunja tanggv ba\" specifies the distance, \"five hundred l\u01d0.\"\n- \"funqembi\" suggests something is \"left over\" or \"in excess.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence can be translated as:\n\n###From here to the capital city, arriving in a great form, five hundred l\u01d0 remain.###"
