    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"sithvme taqibumbio sithvme taqiburakvn\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **sithvme**: This word is derived from \"sithvme kiqembi,\" which means \"to work hard\" or \"to act in a diligent fashion.\" The parent word \"sithvmbi\" implies applying oneself, being diligent, exerting oneself, concentrating on, or being absorbed in something. In this context, \"sithvme\" suggests an action of working hard or being diligent.\n\n2. **taqibumbio**: This is derived from \"taqibumbi,\" which means \"to teach\" or \"to instruct.\" The parent word \"taqimbi\" means \"to learn\" or \"to study,\" but in this form, it specifically refers to the act of teaching or instructing.\n\n3. **sithvme**: Again, this word means \"to work hard\" or \"to act in a diligent fashion,\" as explained previously.\n\n4. **taqiburakvn**: This is a negative imperfect participle form of \"taqibumbi,\" which means \"to teach\" or \"to instruct.\" The negative participle \"rakv\" indicates the absence or negation of the action.
