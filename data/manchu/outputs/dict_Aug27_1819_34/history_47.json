    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"age sini hala ai\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **age**: This word can mean \"Prince, son of an Emperor,\" \"master, sir, lord\" (as a polite term of address), or it can be an exclamation like \"Ouch!\" or \"Ow!\". In the context of this sentence, it seems more appropriate to use the polite term of address \"master, sir, lord\" since it is followed by \"sini,\" which is a possessive pronoun, suggesting a formal or respectful address.\n\n2. **sini**: This is the genitive form of \"si,\" meaning \"your.\" It indicates possession, so it is used to show that something belongs to the person being addressed.\n\n3. **hala**: This word can mean \"clan, family, family name\" or \"kind, style, sort.\" Given the context of the sentence, \"family name\" or \"clan\" seems to be the most appropriate translation, as it is common to inquire about someone's family name in a formal or respectful context.\n\n4. **ai**: This word can mean \"what?\" or \"which?\" It is used to form a question, which fits well at the end of the sentence to inquire about something.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence \"age sini hala ai\" can be translated as a respectful inquiry about someone's family name or clan. The translation would be:\n\n###Sir, what is your family name?###"
