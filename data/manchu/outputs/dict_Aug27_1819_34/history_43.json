    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"bi inu gemun heqen i baru genembi\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **bi**: In this context, none of the given meanings (place, location, land, Chinese mile, circumstances, occasion, wager, stake, hegemon, overlord) seem to fit well. However, considering the structure of the sentence and typical Manchu syntax, \"bi\" is likely functioning as a subject pronoun. In Manchu, \"bi\" can also mean \"I\" or \"me,\" which is not listed here but is a common usage.\n\n2. **inu**: This word means \"also\" or \"too.\" It can also mean \"even\" as an adverb, which is the most appropriate meaning in this context, emphasizing the action of going to the capital city.\n\n3. **gemun**: This word means \"the Imperial capital\" or \"the capital.\"\n\n4. **heqen**: This word means \"city\" or \"city wall.\" In this context, \"city\" is the appropriate translation, as it pairs with \"capital\" to describe a specific location.\n\n5. **i**: This is a genitive particle meaning \"of\" or \"belonging to.\" It is used to show possession or association.\n\n6. **baru**: This is a postposition meaning \"toward.\"\n\n7. **genembi**: This verb means \"to go\" or \"to leave.\"\n\nNow, let's put these meanings together to form the translation:\n\n- \"bi\" as \"I\"\n- \"inu\" as \"also\" or \"even\"\n- \"gemun heqen\" as \"the capital city\"\n- \"i baru\" as \"toward\"\n- \"genembi\" as \"go\"\n\nCombining these, the sentence \"bi inu gemun heqen i baru genembi\" translates to:\n\n###I also go toward the capital city.###"
