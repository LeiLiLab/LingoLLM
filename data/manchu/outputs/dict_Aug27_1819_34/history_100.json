    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"bi yali qolame bahanarakv\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **bi**: The dictionary provides several meanings for \"bi,\" including \"place,\" \"location,\" \"land,\" \"circumstances,\" \"occasion,\" \"wager,\" \"stake,\" and \"hegemon.\" In the context of this sentence, none of these meanings seem directly applicable. However, \"bi\" can also be a pronoun meaning \"I\" or \"me\" in Manchu, which fits better in this context.\n\n2. **yali**: This word means \"meat\" or \"flesh.\" Given the context of the sentence, it is likely referring to \"meat.\"\n\n3. **qolame**: This word means \"to stir-fry.\" It is an action word indicating the method of cooking.\n\n4. **bahanarakv**: This is a negative imperfect participle derived from \"bahanambi,\" which means \"to go to get,\" \"to be able,\" \"to know how to do something,\" \"to experience,\" or \"to understand.\" The negative imperfect participle form \"bahanarakv\" suggests the meaning \"not able to\" or \"unable to.\"\n\nPutting these meanings together, the sentence \"bi yali qolame bahanarakv\" can be translated as:\n\n- \"bi\" = \"I\"\n- \"yali\" = \"meat\"\n- \"qolame\" = \"to stir-fry\"\n- \"bahanarakv\" = \"unable to\"\n\nTherefore, the translation of the sentence is: \"I am unable to stir-fry meat.\"\n\n###I am unable to stir-fry meat###"
