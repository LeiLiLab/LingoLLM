    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"mini hala wang\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **mini**: This is the genitive form of \"bi,\" which means \"my\" or \"of me.\" It indicates possession. The parent word definitions provided do not seem relevant in this context, as \"mini\" is clearly used as a possessive pronoun here.\n\n2. **hala**: This word can mean \"clan,\" \"family,\" or \"family name.\" Given the context, it is most likely referring to a \"family name\" or \"clan.\"\n\n3. **wang**: This is a loanword from Chinese (\u738b), which can mean \"prince\" or \"king.\" In this context, it is likely referring to a \"prince,\" as \"wang\" is often used in Manchu to denote nobility or royalty.\n\nPutting it all together, \"mini hala wang\" translates to \"my family name is Wang\" or \"Wang is my family name,\" depending on the context. The sentence indicates that the speaker's family name is Wang.\n\n###My family name is Wang###"
