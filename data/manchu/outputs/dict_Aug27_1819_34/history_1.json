    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"bi qoohiyan wangging qi jihe\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **bi**: This word has several meanings, but none of them seem to fit well with the context of the sentence. However, in Manchu, \"bi\" can also function as the first-person singular pronoun \"I\" or \"me,\" which is not listed in the provided dictionary entry but is a common usage in Manchu. Given the structure of the sentence, it is likely that \"bi\" here means \"I.\"\n\n2. **qoohiyan**: This is a toponym referring to \"Korea.\"\n\n3. **wangging**: This refers to \"the capital of Korea.\"\n\n4. **qi**: This functions as an ablative participle meaning \"from\" or \"by way of.\"\n\n5. **jihe**: This is the perfect participle form of \"jimbito,\" which means \"come.\" So \"jihe\" translates to \"came.\"\n\nPutting these meanings together, the sentence \"bi qoohiyan wangging qi jihe\" translates to:\n\n\"I came from the capital of Korea.\"\n\nThus, the translation of the sentence is:\n\n###I came from the capital of Korea###"
