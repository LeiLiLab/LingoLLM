    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"aniyadari haji be seremxe erindari hvlha be seremxe\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **aniyadari**: This translates to \"every year.\" The parent word is \"aniyayear,\" indicating a recurring annual event or action.\n\n2. **haji**: This word has multiple meanings, but in this context, \"scarce, lean (year), famine\" seems most appropriate. The sentence seems to discuss regular occurrences related to scarcity or defense, so \"famine\" fits well.\n\n3. **be**: This is an accusative particle, which marks the direct object of a verb. It helps to indicate what is being acted upon in the sentence.\n\n4. **seremxe**: Derived from \"seremxen,\" meaning \"defense\" or \"prevention.\" The parent word \"seremxembi\" includes meanings like \"to guard\" or \"to take precautions.\" Here, \"defense\" or \"prevention\" seems appropriate.\n\n5. **erindari**: This translates to \"often\" or \"regularly.\" The parent word \"erin\" relates to time, indicating a frequent or regular action.\n\n6. **hvlha**: This word means \"bandit,\" \"robber,\" or \"thief.\" It can also mean \"rebel\" or \"secret.\" In this context, \"bandit\" or \"robber\" is likely the most fitting translation.\n\n7. **be**: Again, this is the accusative particle, marking the direct object of a verb.\n\n8. **seremxe**: As before, this means \"defense\" or \"prevention,\" derived from \"seremxen.\"\n\nNow, let's put these translations together to form a coherent English sentence:\n\n\"Every year, famine prevention is regularly done against bandits.\"\n\n###Every year, famine prevention is regularly done against bandits.###"
