    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **sini**: This is the genitive form of \"si,\" meaning \"your.\" It indicates possession.\n\n2. **hendurengge**: This is an imperfect substantive form of \"hendu-re-ngge,\" which means \"what is being said.\" The parent word \"hendumbi\" means \"to say\" or \"to speak.\"\n\n3. **inu**: This word can mean \"also,\" \"too,\" \"even,\" \"so,\" \"yes,\" or \"correct.\" In this context, \"also\" or \"too\" seems appropriate, as it is used to connect ideas.\n\n4. **mini**: This is the genitive form of \"bi,\" meaning \"my\" or \"of me.\" It indicates possession.\n\n5. **mujilen**: This word means \"mind,\" \"intention,\" or \"heart\" in a figurative sense.\n\n6. **de**: This is a dative/locative particle meaning \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" \"on,\" or \"by.\" It indicates the direction or location of an action or state.\n\n7. **inu**: Again, this word can mean \"also,\" \"too,\" \"even,\" \"so,\" \"yes,\" or \"correct.\" Here, \"also\" or \"too\" is likely appropriate, as it connects ideas similarly to the previous use.\n\n8. **uttu**: This word means \"thus,\" \"like this,\" or \"so.\" It describes the manner or way something is done.\n\n9. **gvnihabi**: This is the perfect participle form of \"gvniha,\" derived from \"gvnimbito,\" which means \"to think,\" \"to reflect,\" \"to consider,\" or \"to intend.\" It indicates a completed action of thinking or considering.\n\nNow, let's put these meanings together to form a coherent English translation:\n\n- \"sini hendurengge\" translates to \"what is being said by you\" or \"your words.\"\n- \"inu\" adds the meaning of \"also\" or \"too.\"\n- \"mini mujilen de\" translates to \"in my mind\" or \"to my heart.\"\n- The second \"inu\" again adds \"also\" or \"too.\"\n- \"uttu gvnihabi\" translates to \"I have thought\" or \"I have considered thus.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence can be translated as:\n\n###Your words have also been considered in my heart thus.###"
