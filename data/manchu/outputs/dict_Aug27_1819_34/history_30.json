    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"mini taqihangge hontohon aniya funqehe\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **mini**: This is the genitive form of \"bi,\" meaning \"my\" or \"of me.\" It indicates possession.\n\n2. **taqihangge**: This is derived from the parent word \"taqimbi,\" which means \"to learn\" or \"to study.\" The form \"taqi-ha-ngge\" is a perfect substantive, which often translates to \"what has been learned\" or \"the learned.\"\n\n3. **hontohon**: This word can mean \"half,\" \"a bannerman with half salary,\" or \"section of an organization.\" In this context, \"half\" seems to be the most appropriate translation.\n\n4. **aniya**: This translates to \"year.\"\n\n5. **funqehe**: This is derived from the parent word \"funqembi,\" meaning \"to be left over\" or \"to be in excess.\" The form \"funqe-he-ngge\" translates to \"leftovers\" or \"what is left over.\"\n\nNow, let's put these meanings together to form a coherent English translation:\n\n- \"mini\" indicates possession, so \"my.\"\n- \"taqihangge\" refers to \"what has been learned\" or \"the learned.\"\n- \"hontohon\" translates to \"half.\"\n- \"aniya\" means \"year.\"\n- \"funqehe\" means \"leftovers\" or \"what is left over.\"\n\nCombining these, the sentence can be translated as:\n\n\"My learned half-year leftovers.\"\n\nThis suggests that the speaker is referring to something learned or studied that pertains to the remaining half of a year. However, without additional context, the exact meaning can be somewhat open to interpretation.\n\n###My learned half-year leftovers###"
