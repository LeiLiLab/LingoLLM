    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"yasai juleri ere uthai wase diyan\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **yasai**: This word is the genitive or instrumental form of \"yasa,\" which means \"eye\" or \"a round hole, mesh of a net.\" In this context, \"yasai\" could mean \"of the eye/eyes\" or \"with the eyes.\" Given the sentence structure, \"with the eyes\" seems more appropriate.\n\n2. **juleri**: This word means \"front\" or \"in front.\" It suggests a location or position relative to something else.\n\n3. **ere**: This word translates to \"this.\" It is a demonstrative pronoun referring to something specific.\n\n4. **uthai**: This word has several meanings, including \"then,\" \"thereupon,\" \"at once,\" \"and then,\" \"immediately,\" as well as \"ordinary\" or \"common.\" Given the sentence context, \"then\" or \"immediately\" seems most appropriate, indicating a sequence of actions or events.\n\n5. **wase**: This word can mean \"tile,\" \"pottery,\" \"earthenware,\" or \"socks, stockings.\" In the context of a sentence that includes \"diyan\" (which could refer to a palace or inn), \"tile\" or \"pottery\" seems more relevant, as these could be materials associated with such buildings.\n\n6. **diyan**: This word can mean \"palace,\" \"throne room,\" \"great hall,\" or \"hostel,\" \"inn.\" In this context, it likely refers to a \"palace\" or \"great hall,\" given the potential connection with \"tile\" or \"pottery.\"\n\nNow, let's construct the translation of the sentence based on these interpretations:\n\n\"With the eyes in front, this immediately [or then] [tile/pottery] palace.\"\n\nThis translation suggests a scenario where something is being observed or approached with the eyes, leading to an immediate action or realization involving a palace or great hall, possibly constructed or adorned with tiles or pottery.\n\nTherefore, the most coherent translation in English, considering the context and word meanings, would be:\n\n###With the eyes in front, this immediately leads to the palace.###"
