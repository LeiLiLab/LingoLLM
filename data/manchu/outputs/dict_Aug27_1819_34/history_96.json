    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"tere booi amala hvqin bi\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **tere**: This word can mean \"that,\" \"he,\" \"she,\" or \"it.\" In this context, \"that\" seems to be the most appropriate translation, as it often refers to something specific in a narrative or description.\n\n2. **booi**: This is the genitive form of \"boo,\" which means \"of the house\" or \"of the family.\" The genitive case indicates possession, so \"booi\" would translate to \"of the house\" or \"of the family.\"\n\n3. **amala**: This word can mean \"behind,\" \"after,\" or \"later.\" In this context, \"behind\" seems to be the most appropriate translation, especially if we are describing a location relative to something else.\n\n4. **hvqin**: This word translates to \"a well,\" which is a structure created to access groundwater.\n\n5. **bi**: This word has several meanings, but in this context, it seems to be used as a location marker. Therefore, \"place\" or \"location\" would be the most appropriate translation.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the sentence \"tere booi amala hvqin bi\" can be translated to:\n\n###Behind that house, there is a well.###"
