    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"bi gemun heqen i baru genembi\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **bi**: In this context, none of the meanings such as \"place, location, land, Chinese mile, circumstances, occasion, wager, stake, hegemon, overlord\" seem to fit directly. However, given the structure of the sentence and typical Manchu syntax, \"bi\" is likely a particle or a placeholder that does not translate directly into English in this context. It could be an emphatic particle or part of a phrase structure that doesn't have a direct English equivalent.\n\n2. **gemun**: This translates to \"the Imperial capital\" or \"the capital.\" In the context of the sentence, it refers to a specific capital city.\n\n3. **heqen**: This means \"city\" or \"city wall.\" Here, it likely refers to the city itself.\n\n4. **i**: This is a genitive particle meaning \"of\" or \"belonging to.\" It shows possession or association between \"gemun heqen\" and what follows.\n\n5. **baru**: This is a postposition meaning \"toward.\" It indicates direction.\n\n6. **genembi**: This means \"to go\" or \"to leave.\" It is the action being described in the sentence.\n\nNow, putting these meanings together, the sentence \"bi gemun heqen i baru genembi\" can be translated into English as:\n\n###I go toward the capital city###"
