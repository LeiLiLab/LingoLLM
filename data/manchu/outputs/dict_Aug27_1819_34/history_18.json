The other meanings like \"space, gap, interval,\" \"a file of five men,\" or \"obstruction, blocking\" do not fit well in this context.\n\n2. **wede**: This is the dative form of \"we,\" meaning \"to whom\" or \"for whom.\" It indicates the indirect object of the sentence.\n\n3. **bithe**: This word can mean \"book,\" \"letter,\" \"written symbol,\" or \"civil.\" In this context, \"letter\" seems to be the most appropriate translation, as it is something that can be learned or studied.\n\n4. **taqiha**: This is the perfect participle form of \"taqimbi,\" which means \"to learn\" or \"to study.\" The perfect participle \"taqiha\" indicates that the action has been completed, so it translates to \"learned\" or \"studied.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence \"si wede bithe taqiha\" can be translated as:\n\n###You have learned the letter for whom.###"
