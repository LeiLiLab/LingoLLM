    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **bi**: This word has several meanings, but in the context of this sentence, it seems to function as a pronoun. Since there is no clear indication of it being a place or location, and given the sentence structure, it is likely a pronoun. However, the dictionary does not provide a direct pronoun meaning, so we will consider it as part of the sentence structure without a direct translation.\n\n2. **daqi**: This word can mean \"from the beginning,\" \"once upon a time,\" or \"formerly.\" In this context, \"from the beginning\" or \"formerly\" seems appropriate, as it sets a temporal context for the action.\n\n3. **nikan**: This word refers to \"Chinese\" or \"southern Chinese.\" In this context, it is likely referring to \"Chinese\" people.\n\n4. **i**: This is a genitive particle meaning \"of\" or \"belonging to.\" It indicates possession or association.\n\n5. **niyalma**: This word means \"man,\" \"person,\" or \"someone else.\" Here, it likely refers to \"person\" or \"people.\"\n\n6. **de**: This is a dative/locative particle meaning \"to,\" \"in,\" \"at,\" or \"on.\" In this context, it likely means \"to.\"\n\n7. **bithe**: This word means \"book\" or \"letter.\" Given the context, \"letter\" seems more appropriate as it involves communication.\n\n8. **taqiha**: This is the perfect participle form of \"taqimbi,\" which means \"to learn\" or \"to study.\" Here, \"learned\" or \"studied\" would be appropriate.\n\n9. **be**: This is an accusative particle, indicating the direct object of the verb.\n\n10. **dahame**: This is a postposition meaning \"because\" or \"since.\" It indicates the reason or cause for the action.\n\nNow, let's construct the translation based on the meanings of the individual words:\n\n- \"bi\" does not have a direct translation here but is part of the sentence structure.\n- \"daqi\" translates to \"formerly\" or \"from the beginning.\"\n- \"nikan i niyalma\" translates to \"Chinese person\" or \"Chinese people.\"\n- \"de\" translates to \"to.\"\n- \"bithe\" translates to \"letter.\"\n- \"taqiha\" translates to \"learned.\"\n- \"be\" indicates the object, which is the \"letter.\"\n- \"dahame\" translates to \"because.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence can be translated as:\n\n###Formerly, because a Chinese person learned the letter.###"
