    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"umesi bolho diyan be baime tatame genefi ulha teyebuki\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **umesi**: This word means \"very\" or \"to a high degree.\" It is an adverb that intensifies the adjective or verb it modifies.\n\n2. **bolho**: This word has several meanings, including \"clean,\" \"clear,\" \"honest,\" \"sincere,\" \"incorrupt,\" \"pure,\" and \"serene.\" Given the context, it likely modifies the noun \"diyan,\" so \"clean\" or \"clear\" could be appropriate.\n\n3. **diyan**: This word can mean \"palace,\" \"throne room,\" \"great hall,\" or \"hostel,\" \"inn.\" The context of the sentence will determine which meaning fits best, but without additional context, we can assume it refers to a \"palace\" or \"great hall.\"\n\n4. **be**: This is an accusative particle used to mark the direct object of a verb. It indicates that \"diyan\" is the object of the action.\n\n5. **baime**: This is a postposition meaning \"toward.\" It indicates direction or purpose.\n\n6. **tatame**: This is an imperfect converb form of \"tatambi,\" which can mean \"to pull,\" \"to stop on a journey,\" \"to make camp,\" among other meanings. In this context, \"to make camp\" or \"to stop\" could be appropriate.\n\n7. **genefi**: This is a perfect converb form of \"genembi,\" meaning \"to go\" or \"to leave.\" It indicates a completed action.\n\n8. **ulha**: This word means \"livestock\" or \"domestic animal.\"\n\n9. **teyebuki**: This is a causative form of \"teyembi,\" meaning \"to be at ease,\" \"to relax,\" or \"to rest.\" It implies causing someone or something to be at ease or to rest.\n\nNow, let's translate the sentence:\n\n- \"umesi\" (very) modifies \"bolho\" (clean/clear), describing the \"diyan\" (palace).\n- \"be\" marks \"diyan\" as the object.\n- \"baime\" (toward) indicates direction or purpose.\n- \"tatame\" (to make camp) and \"genefi\" (having gone) describe the action.\n- \"ulha\" (livestock) is the subject that is being caused to \"teyebuki\" (rest).\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence can be translated as:\n\n###Having gone to make camp toward the very clean palace, the livestock were caused to rest.###"
