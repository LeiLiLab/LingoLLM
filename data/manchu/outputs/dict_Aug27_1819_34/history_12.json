    "content": "Let's break down the Manchu sentence \"bi adarame bahafi sambi\" word by word using the provided dictionary entries:\n\n1. **bi**: The dictionary provides several meanings for \"bi,\" including \"place,\" \"location,\" \"land,\" \"circumstances,\" \"occasion,\" \"wager,\" \"stake,\" and \"hegemon.\" In the context of the sentence, none of these meanings seem to fit well, as the sentence seems to be asking a question or making a statement about an action. Therefore, \"bi\" could be serving as a particle or a grammatical marker rather than having a direct translation in this context.\n\n2. **adarame**: This word is used to ask questions like \"How?\" or \"Why?\" It indicates a query about the manner or reason for something.\n\n3. **bahafi**: This is a perfect converb form derived from \"bahambi,\" meaning \"to manage to\" or \"to succeed in.\" It suggests the completion or successful execution of an action, which will be specified by the following verb.\n\n4. **sambi**: The primary meaning of \"sambi\" in this context is \"to know\" or \"to understand.\" This fits well with the context, as the sentence seems to be inquiring about understanding or knowing something.\n\nPutting these meanings together, the sentence \"bi adarame bahafi sambi\" can be translated as a question about understanding or knowing something, specifically focusing on the manner or reason for that understanding. The translation could be:\n\n###How did you manage to know?###"
